/*zookeeper: This service is like Kafka's brain. It manages the state of the Kafka cluster, tracks which brokers are alive, and holds configuration data.

kafka: This is the main Kafka broker (the "post office").

depends_on: - zookeeper: This tells Docker to start ZooKeeper before starting Kafka, which is required.

ports: - "9092:9092": This maps port 9092 on your local machine to port 9092 inside the Docker container. This is the default port Spring Boot will use to talk to Kafka.

KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092: This is a key line. It tells Kafka, "If anyone (like your Spring Boot app) wants to talk to you, tell them to connect to localhost:9092."
